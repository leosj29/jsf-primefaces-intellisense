        "description": "The <o:tree> allows the developers to have full control over the markup of a tree hierarchy by declaring the appropriate JSF components or HTML elements in the markup. The <o:tree> does namely not render any HTML markup by itself.  The component value must point to a tree of data objects represented by a TreeModel instance, typically established via a ValueExpression . During iterative processing over the nodes of tree in the tree model, the object for the current node is exposed as a request attribute under the key specified by the var attribute. The node itself is exposed as a request attribute under the key specified by the varNode attribute.  The <o:tree> tag supports only child tags of type <o:treeNode> , representing parent tree nodes. There can be multiple <o:treeNode> tags, each representing a separate parent tree node level, so that different markup could be declared for each tree node level, if necessary. The <o:treeNode> tag in turn supports child tag <o:treeNodeItem> which represents each child of the current parent tree node. The <o:treeNodeItem> in turn supports child tag <o:treeInsertChildren> which represents the insertion point of the grand children.  Here is a basic usage example where each parent tree node level is treated the same way via a single <o:treeNode> : <pre>\n<o:tree value=\"#{bean.treeModel}\" var=\"item\" varNode=\"node\"> <o:treeNode> <ul> <o:treeNodeItem> <li> #{node.index} #{item.someProperty} <o:treeInsertChildren /> </li> </o:treeNodeItem> </ul> </o:treeNode>\n</o:tree> </pre>",

The UIInput components must be referenced by a space separated collection of their client IDs in the components attribute. This validator can be placed anywhere in the form, but keep in mind that the components will be validated in the order as they appear in the form.

If this validator fails, then the component's own validators will not be fired. If this validator is been placed after all of the components, then it will be executed after any of the component's own validators. If any of them fails, then this validator will not be exeucted. It is not recommended to put this validator somewhere in between the referenced components as the resulting behaviour may be confusing. Put this validator either before or after all of the components, depending on how you would like to prioritize the validation. <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields id=\"myId\" components=\"foo bar baz\" />\n<h:message for=\"myId\" />\n<h:inputText id=\"foo\" />\n<h:inputText id=\"bar\" />\n<h:inputText id=\"baz\" /> </pre>  By default, in an invalidating case, all of the referenced components will be marked invalid and a faces message will be added on the client ID of this validator component.

Any \"{0}\" placeholder in the message will be substituted with a comma separated string of labels of the referenced input components. <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" message=\"{0} are wrong!\" /> </pre>  You can use invalidateAll=\"false\" to mark only those components which are actually invalid as invalid. In case of for example \"input all\" or \"input all or none\" validation, that would be only the fields which are left empty. <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" message=\"{0} are wrong!\" invalidateAll=\"false\" /> </pre>  The faces message can also be shown for all of the referenced components using showMessageFor=\"@all\" . <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" message=\"This is wrong!\" showMessageFor=\"@all\" />\n<h:inputText id=\"foo\" />\n<h:message for=\"foo\" />\n<h:inputText id=\"bar\" />\n<h:message for=\"bar\" />\n<h:inputText id=\"baz\" />\n<h:message for=\"baz\" /> </pre>  The faces message can also be shown for only the invalidated components using showMessageFor=\"@invalid\" . <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" message=\"This is wrong!\" showMessageFor=\"@invalid\" /> </pre>  The faces message can also be shown as global message using showMessageFor=\"@global\" . <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" message=\"This is wrong!\" showMessageFor=\"@global\" /> </pre>  The faces message can also be shown for specific components referenced by a space separated collection of their client IDs in showMessageFor attribute. <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" message=\"This is wrong!\" showMessageFor=\"foo baz\" /> </pre>  The showMessageFor attribute defaults to @this .  The validator can be disabled by the disabled attribute. It accepts a request based EL expression. <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields components=\"foo bar baz\" disabled=\"#{param.validationDisabled}\" /> </pre>  There is a read-only validationFailed attribute which can be used to determine if the validation by this component has failed. <pre>\n<o:validateMultipleFields id=\"myId\" binding=\"#{myId}\" components=\"foo bar baz\" />\n<h:panelGroup rendered=\"#{myId.validationFailed}\"> Validation has failed! <h:message for=\"myId\" />\n</h:panelGroup> </pre>",

The standard UIViewParameter implementation calls the model setter again after postback. This is not always desired when being bound to a view scoped bean and can lead to performance problems when combined with an expensive converter. To solve this, this component by default stores the submitted value as a component property instead of in the model (and thus in the view state in case the binding is to a view scoped bean).  The standard UIViewParameter implementation calls the converter regardless of whether the evaluated model value is null or not. As converters by specification return an empty string in case of null value, this is being added to the query string as an empty parameter. This is not desired.  The standard UIViewParameter implementation uses an internal \"is required\" check when the submitted value is null , hereby completely bypassing the standard UIInput validation, including any bean validation annotations and even the PreValidateEvent and PostValidateEvent events. This is not desired.  You can use it the same way as <f:viewParam> , you only need to change f: to o: .",

If the maximum capacity is reached, an entry will be evicted following a least recently used policy. The default time to live specifies for how long entries are considered to be valid.

This tag can be placed inside <f:metadata> or <f|o:viewParam> . When placed in <f|o:viewParam> , then it will be applied when the particular view parameter has a validation error as per UIViewParameter#isValid() . When placed in <f:metadata> , and no one view parameter has already handled the validation error via its own <o:viewParamValidationFailed> , then it will be applied when there's a general validation error as per FacesContext#isValidationFailed() .  The sendRedirect attribute uses under the covers Faces#redirect(String, String...) to send the redirect, so the same rules as to scheme and leading slash apply here. The sendError attribute uses under the covers Faces#responseSendError(int, String) to send the error, so you can customize HTTP error pages via <error-page> entries in web.xml , otherwise the server-default one will be displayed instead. * <h3>f:viewParam required=\"true\" fail</h3>  As a precaution, the <f:viewParam required=\"true\"> has in current Mojarra and MyFaces releases (as of now, Mojarra 2.2.7 and MyFaces 2.2.4) a design error. When the parameter is not specified in the query string, then it is retrieved as null which causes that an internal isRequired() check is performed instead of delegating the check to standard UIInput implementation. This has the consequence that PreValidateEvent and PostValidateEvent listeners are never invoked, which the <o:viewParamValidationFailed> is actually relying on. This is fixed in <o:viewParam . * <h3>Examples</h3>  With the example below, when at least one view param is absent, then the client will be returned a HTTP 400 error. <pre> <f:metadata> <o:viewParam name=\"foo\" required=\"true\" /> <o:viewParam name=\"bar\" required=\"true\" /> <o:viewParamValidationFailed sendError=\"400\" /> </f:metadata> </pre>  With the example below, only when the \"foo\" parameter is absent, then the client will be redirected to \"login.xhtml\". When the \"bar\" parameter is absent, nothing new will happen. The process will proceed \"as usual\". I.e. the validation error will end up as a faces message in the current view the usual way. <pre> <f:metadata> <o:viewParam name=\"foo\" required=\"true\"> <o:viewParamValidationFailed sendRedirect=\"login.xhtml\" /> </o:viewParam> <o:viewParam name=\"bar\" required=\"true\" /> </f:metadata> </pre>  With the example below, only when the \"foo\" parameter is absent, regardless of the \"bar\" or \"baz\" parameters, then the client will be returned a HTTP 401 error. When the \"foo\" parameter is present, but either \"bar\" or \"baz\" parameter is absent, then the client will be redirected to \"search.xhtml\". <pre> <f:metadata> <o:viewParam name=\"foo\" required=\"true\"> <o:viewParamValidationFailed sendError=\"401\" /> </o:viewParam> <o:viewParam name=\"bar\" required=\"true\" /> <o:viewParam name=\"baz\" required=\"true\" /> <o:viewParamValidationFailed sendRedirect=\"search.xhtml\" /> </f:metadata> </pre>  In a nutshell: when there are multiple <o:viewParamValidationFailed> tags, then they will be applied in the same order as they are declared in the view. So, with the example above, the one nested in <f|o:viewParam> takes precedence over the one nested in <f:metadata> . * <h3>Messaging</h3>  By default, the first occurring faces message on the parent component will be copied, or when there is none, then the first occurring global faces message will be copied. When sendRedirect is used, then it will be set as a global flash error message. When sendError is used, then it will be set as HTTP status message.  You can override this message by explicitly specifying the message attribute. This is applicable on both sendRedirect and sendError . <pre> <o:viewParamValidationFailed sendRedirect=\"search.xhtml\" message=\"You need to perform a search.\" /> ... <o:viewParamValidationFailed sendError=\"401\" message=\"Authentication failed. You need to login.\" /> </pre> * <h3>Design notes</h3>  You can technically nest multiple <o:viewParamValidationFailed> inside the same parent, but this is not the documented approach and the behavior is unspecified.  You can not change the HTTP status code of a redirect. This is not a JSF limitation, but a HTTP limitation. The status code of a redirect will always end up the one of the redirected response. If you intend to \"redirect\" with a different HTTP status code, then you should be using sendError instead and specify the desired page as <error-page> in web.xml .",

Below example assumes a List<Category> as value wherein Category in turn has a List<Product> . <pre>\n<h:selectOneMenu value=\"#{bean.selectedProduct}\" converter=\"omnifaces.SelectItemsConverter\"> <f:selectItem itemValue=\"#{null}\" /> <o:selectItemGroups value=\"#{bean.categories}\" var=\"category\" itemLabel=\"#{category.name}\"> <f:selectItems value=\"#{category.products}\" var=\"product\" itemLabel=\"#{product.name}\" /> </o:selectItemGroups>\n</h:selectOneMenu> </pre>",
